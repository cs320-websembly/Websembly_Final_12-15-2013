PLEASE NOTE: Before running Websembly, it is IMPORTANT to change the image paths. All images for Websembly are in the Resources folder of Websembly_final. Please change all image file paths according to Websembly_final's location on your computer. File paths will need to be changed both in SufaceWindow1.xaml and SurfaceWindow1.cs. Running Websembly without changing the file paths will result in an null pointer error. 

CREDITS: Websembly is an application created by Emma Haley, Alex Poon, Monica Starr Feldman and Emily Tohir for Wellesley College CS 320: Tangible User Interfaces during Fall 2013. Special thanks to Orit Shaer. All visual and design attributes for Websembly were created by Emma Haley.

ABOUT WEBSEMBLY: Websembly is a Microsoft Surface application that aims to show novice coders how HTML code is affected when adding elements to a web page. With Websembly, users can upload pictures and videos saved on their Wellesley OneCards and create a website by dragging and dropping their personalized content into a style sheet of their choosing. Furthermore, users are able to type text into specified areas of the style sheet. With each change made to the style sheet, users are able to view changes to the HTML code in real time. Once the user has created a website that he or she is happy with, the user can save the code back to their Wellesley OneCard, as demonstrated in the Websembly Demo Video.
